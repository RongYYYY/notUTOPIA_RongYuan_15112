Description

not UTOPIA is an auto-generated 3D maze in which the player would need to utilize the roads and the ladders to get from the left-top point of the maze to the right-bottom. 
     There are two modes: 
	Sunny Mode: Go through the maze and collect all of the 'sunshine' and bring them to finish. 
	Foggy Mode: You can only see 3*3 around you but still explore the maze and go to finish. 
     Select color theme, mode, and scale(difficulty) at main screen and proceed.
